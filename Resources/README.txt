Thank you for downloading the SpaceNavigator Driver!

First, some prerequisites to running it..

You'll need the Xerces C++ library Version 2.7.0 to run it.  You can download the library directly from the source, using the link below.

Newer versions may work, but 2.7.0 is what the driver application is developed with.

You can find LOTS of discussion about this project at the following URL.

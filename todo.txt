* Add actions to perform on join/leave of a context
* Possibly "lock" an axis so that only input on that axis is accepted once it's past it's threshold
* Flesh-out generic HID to support other devices
	- Have it auto detect number of axis and buttons
	- Determine if all axis are reported the same, or if the input report describes how to extract data
		- It appears that the "feature" report describes the format of the input reports.
* Provide a more "direct" way to context switch internally, instead of requiring a window message be sent and received by the same app
* Make threshold in percent of screen, rather than pixels for Mouse Capture Device
* Consider adding a "snap to center" function for the Mouse Capture Device
* Figure out and/or fix the sequencing for the Macro actions -- Probably caused by issue described below.
* Replace std::map with some other mechanism that can maintain the order of the items, but still have a lookup key.  -- Post #284
* Investigate reversed direction for axes simulating mouse movement.

*** Create a configuration app, that helps (or completely handles) write config.xml file(s)


--- DONE ---
* Add a "Global" context that is always executed before the currently selected context.  Useful for always switching to/from a particular context when a particular button is pushed, without adding that action to each context.
